        Long before the American Creativity Academy established the Senior Committee, students demonstrated their commitment to making their senior year memorable. The seniors truly demonstrated their creativity in making their senior year the best year yet, from designing the senior apparel to producing the senior song. Our turn has finally come, as we recall our earlier days of looking up to past seniors as rolemodels. Our dream became a reality today. The Class of 2023 has finally reached senior year after a lengthy 14 years of hard work and commitment.

        The Senior Committee is a community organization aiming to organize senior-related events so that the students who have been together for around 14 years can make the most of their senior year. As members of the Senior Committee, we intend to make this a memorable year filled with activities and events, and we sincerely hope that you will join us during the academic school year.

        The Senior Committee is about serving the senior class, not only its members. Although one person is insufficient to serve on this committee, a team is capable of leaving a lasting impression on future classes at ACA, and we sincerely hope that we will.
